San Lorenzo Ranch offers horses and riders a professional full-service boarding and training facility at the heart of the Russian River. The ranch is located on 52 acres in Forestville and offers 2 barns each with fully matted 12x12 stalls, tack rooms, cross ties, and wash racks with hot and cold water. Riders have access to both indoor dressage and outdoor jump arenas, galloping track, and miles of trails. A cross-country field is also being designed.
