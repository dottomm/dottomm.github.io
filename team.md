{% include image.html url="/assets/images/DavidFlowerJump.jpg" description="David Adamo" %}

Originally from San Diego, CA, David started riding at the age of 6 and was introduced to Eventing at the age of sixteen through his local pony club. Three years later, in 1987, at the age of nineteen, David achieved his USPC HA and A ratings. While attending the University of California, Davis he was the captain of the UCD Eventing Team. During this time began developing his own teaching and training style working with the local Pony Clubs in the Davis area. He then went on to participate in the USPC traveling instructor program for two summers. In 1990 he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Agricultural Science and Management. He is a Level 3 ICP certified instructor and is a certified cross country course designer. From 2006-2008 he was the United States Eventing Association Area VI (California) Chairman. His main influences have been the teaching of IPC faculty member Brian Sabo and USET team member and FEI judge Jim Graham. Other strong influences on his riding and training have come from work with Jimmy Wofford, Mark Phillips, Karen O'Connor, Lilo Fore for dressage, and Anne Kursinski for show jumping.

From 2008 thru 2012 David moved to the southeast to compete and train on the east coast circuit where he competed successfully thru the advanced level on Prince Noah and River King, both horses he had brought along from the Novice level. He has been back in California since early 2012 and has brought up 3 more horses to the CCI* level, Christiana Rosenblatt's Toukoutou, Ann Patton's La Patrona, and Henry whom he owns with Theresa Simmons and Maggie Weems. Henry was also the winner of the 2014 Preliminary Horse challenge at Woodside Horse Park in May. In 2015 David is looking forward to bringing Prince Noah back up to the upper levels, competing Henry at Intermediate and 2 star levels, and starting competition with the very exciting Rockstar, owned by John Miller.


<h2>Pam Wright: Barn Manager</h2>
{% include image.html url="/assets/images/pam_jump.jpeg" description="Pam Wright" %}

Pam became the Head Groom for Adamo Eventing in July 2015. After moving to San Lorenzo Ranch, Pam has become the full time barn manager for Adamo Eventing. Nobody loves the horses like Pam. Her dedication and commitment to the horses and their care is nothing short of legendary. Clients of Adamo eventing rest easy knowing that their precious horses are under Pam's watchful eye. No detail of their health or wellbeing escapes her. Pam has two horses. Gangster is an OTTB with whom she focuses on dressage and her Argentinian gelding Nihiul, whom she events.

Pam grew up in New Jersey, and when she was young, she enjoyed redesigning her Barbieâ€™s wardrobe and placing them on her plastic Bryer horses as they rode up imaginary streams (street gutters) and jumped over trees. It seems her addiction to horses started early!
